In our laboratory's environmental impact assessment (EIA), the concentration of inorganic waste generated during the laboratory's operations is about $1 mg/m^3$, and the concentration of non-methane total hydrocarbons is $10 mg/m^3$, which are both far below the emission standards and local regulatory limits. The EIA and approval require that inorganic waste gas be treated with alkaline scrubbing before discharge, and organic waste gas be treated with UV photolysis and activated carbon before discharge. I have two questions I would like leadership to help answer: 1. Given that the concentration levels are already far below the emission limits, is there still a need for environmental protection facilities? 2. The current environmental bureau guidelines require key VOC-related industries to phase out UV photolysis and similar treatment processes. However, for institutions like ecological environment monitoring agencies, where emission concentrations are already very low, is it necessary to replace UV photolysis?",
